#Creating a customer churn model for a client, specially for understanding and predicting customer behavior. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.
# Churn Model Data Processing

This repository contains scripts for data cleaning, data pivoting, and building a churn model using various machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to preprocess customer data and apply machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.

## Data Cleaning
The following SQL queries are used to clean and explore the data from the database:

```sql
-- Select all records from the table
SELECT * FROM DATABASE."table_name";

-- Select first 10 records from the table
SELECT * FROM Database."table_name" LIMIT 10;

-- Select top 10 records ordered by 'Score' in descending order
SELECT * FROM DATABASE."table_name" ORDER BY "Score" DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Select top 10 records ordered by 'Score' in ascending order
SELECT * FROM DATABASE."table_name" ORDER BY "Score" ASC LIMIT 10;

-- Select specific columns from the table
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

-- Select records where 'Inst' equals 0
SELECT * FROM DATABASE."schema" WHERE "Inst"=0;

-- Group by 'Inst' and count 'Account Key'
SELECT "Inst", COUNT("Account Key") FROM "v_DDA_Accounts" GROUP BY "Inst";

-- Select 'Inst' and 'Account Key' from a specific table
SELECT "Inst","Account Key" FROM PUBLISH.PREMIER_EOM."v_DDA_Accounts_EOM";

-- Select all records ordered by a specific column
SELECT * FROM your_table ORDER BY column_name LIMIT 10;

#Data Pivoting
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
file_path = r'C:\Users\Svc_Apexon2\Downloads\Worksheet1.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()

# Pivot the dataframe
pivoted_df = df.pivot_table(index='ACCT_KEY', columns='DATE_LAST_UPDATED')
pivoted_df
#Machine Learning Model
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
dt = pd.read_csv('Base_Query.csv')
dt_2 = dt[dt['ACCT_TYPE']!='CARD']

# Display dataset information
print(dt.head())
print(len(dt_2))
#pivot data
pvt = pd.pivot_table(dt, index=['ACCT_KEY'], columns=['DATE_LAST_UPDATED'])
pvt_2 = pd.pivot_table(dt_2, index=['ACCT_KEY'], columns=['DATE_LAST_UPDATED'])
#Exploration
print(dt_2[dt_2['ACCT_KEY']=='1-9991000165-1'])

# Example for setting up a model (RandomForestClassifier)
model = RandomForestClassifier()

#Usage
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-model.git
cd churn-model

#data processing script
python data_processing.py

# This `README.md` file provides a comprehensive guide to the scripts, including explanations of the SQL queries, data pivoting, and machine learning steps, along with usage instructions and dependencies. Adjust the repository URL and any specific details as needed.
